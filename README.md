## Abstract

For astrophiles, it is rather difficult to quickly identify the name or get information of the stars in sight.

To determine the name of the target star, they usually use starmap apps, such as star walk2 and Stellarium, to simulate their viewpoint. However, the apps interfere with the experience of stargazing, because they distract astrophiles' attention and harm their eyesight at night. 

Therefore, we propose a new way to observe and learn about stars, that is, by wearing smart glasses to calculate viewpoint and star position and receive verbal cues in real time. Our interaction method can free astrophiles of extra devices, protect their eyesight and satisfy their needs of learning astronomy at any time and any place. 

We interview two photographers and an astrophile to evaluate our product and get high praise in that the interaction method are handy and eye protective.
